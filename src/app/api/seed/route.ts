    title: "Understanding and Managing Erectile Dysfunction: A Complete Medical Guide",
    description: `Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common medical condition that affects millions of men worldwide, yet many suffer in silence due to embarrassment or lack of understanding. This comprehensive guide will provide you with evidence-based information about ED, its causes, treatments, and management strategies.

## What is Erectile Dysfunction?

Erectile dysfunction is defined as the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. While occasional difficulty with erections is normal, ED is typically diagnosed when the problem persists for three months or longer.

## Prevalence and Demographics

ED affects men of all ages but becomes more common with age:
- 40% of men at age 40
- 52% of men at age 50
- 60% of men at age 60
- 70% of men at age 70

However, ED can also affect younger men due to various psychological and lifestyle factors.

## Understanding the Erection Process

To understand ED, it's important to know how erections work:

1. **Mental Stimulation**: Sexual thoughts or stimuli trigger the brain
2. **Nerve Signals**: The brain sends signals through the nervous system
3. **Blood Flow**: Arteries in the penis relax and widen
4. **Blood Trapping**: Blood fills the erectile chambers
5. **Erection**: The penis becomes firm and erect
6. **Detumescence**: After orgasm, blood flows out and the penis becomes flaccid

## Causes of Erectile Dysfunction

### 1. Physical Causes

#### Vascular Diseases (Most Common)
- **Atherosclerosis**: Hardening and narrowing of arteries
- **Hypertension**: High blood pressure damages blood vessels
